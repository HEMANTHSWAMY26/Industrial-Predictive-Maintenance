# Industrial Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a *Deep Learning-Based Framework* for predicting equipment failures in industrial systems. The framework uses a neural network to analyze synthetic data and predict the likelihood of failure based on parameters like equipment age, temperature, and usage.

---

## Project Overview

Predictive maintenance leverages machine learning and deep learning models to forecast equipment failures before they occur. This helps minimize downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and reduce costs.

In this project, we:
- Generate synthetic data representing equipment performance.
- Build a neural network for failure prediction.
- Visualize training performance and feature correlations using graphs and plots.

## Features

- *Synthetic Dataset*: Data includes features like equipment age, temperature, and usage.
- *Neural Network Model*: A simple feed-forward network with two hidden layers for binary classification.
- *Visualizations*:
  - Loss plots to track model performance.
  - Scatter plots for predictions vs. actual data.
  - Feature importance visualization using model weights.
